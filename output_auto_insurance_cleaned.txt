Sample of an Allstate Policy Declarations

* What does “covered accident” mean?
It’s an insurance term that means an accident that falls within the bounds of the policy. 
Throughout the rest of this brochure, when we refer to an accident, we assume it is a 
covered accident.

Policy period. When you pay your   
premium by the due date, your policy 
automatically continues for the time period 
shown, usually six months. 



If you’re at fault in an accident, you could be 

held legally responsible for injury or damage

caused by the accident. All drivers are required 

by law to have both of these liability coverages:

Bodily Injury Liability helps protect 
you from paying medical costs, loss of income 
and funeral expenses of other people involved 
in an accident.

Property Damage Liability helps 
protect you from paying for the repair or 
replacement of another driver’s car.



Automobile Liability Insurance
can help protect your assets.

About coverages.
Auto insurance protects you and your family in all kinds of
situations involving a vehicle. This section of the brochure
summarizes common coverages. Some are optional. Others
are required in certain states. If you’re an Allstate customer,
you can check the coverages you have purchased by looking 
at your Policy Declarations under “Coverage.”

Which vehicles are usually covered by 
an Allstate Policy?

• The vehicle(s) listed on your Policy 
Declarations or any car you replace it with

• Any car you drive while yours is being repaired 
due to an accident

• Any car you rent or borrow

If you damage another person’s car
or other property in an accident,
Allstate can help protect you from
paying for those damages.

Who’s covered under an Allstate policy? 

• You, the policy owner
• Any resident in your home who has a driver’s license
• Anyone you give permission to use your car

If you injure someone in
an accident, Allstate can help
protect you from losing your
savings or home to pay for
those damages. 



Bodily Injury Coverage includes your injuries or death, 
or those of your passengers or family members driving your 
car if it’s hit by a driver with little or no insurance.

Property Damage Coverage includes damage to your car
or property if you’re hit by a driver with little or no insurance.
(Not available in all states.)

There’s a coverage available to protect
you from drivers with no insurance.

There are a lot of drivers out there who may not have car

insurance. What if one of them crashes into you?

Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage can help. 
It’s divided into two parts:

If your car is damaged in an accident by a
driver with little or no car insurance, Allstate
may help pay for repairs or replacement.

If you are hurt in a car
accident by a driver with little 
or no insurance, Allstate will 
help pay for medical expenses.



Automobile Medical Payments Coverage can help
pay for some of your medical costs or funeral expenses if you or
anyone in your vehicle is injured in an accident. 

There’s a coverage that can also help 
pay for your injuries from an accident.

If you’re in an accident, whether it’s your fault or someone 

else’s, paying for medical care can be a concern. That’s where

Allstate Medical Payments Coverage comes in. In some states,

this coverage may be known as Personal Injury Protection and

may cover additional expenses such as loss of wages while 

you’re recovering from an accident. 

If you’re injured in an auto accident,
Allstate will help pay for medical services
you receive within one year of the accident. 
This coverage also applies if you’re a
pedestrian struck by a car.

Your coverage may include hospital bills,
surgeries, x-rays, dental, pharmaceuticals,
nursing services and more due to an injury 
from an auto accident.

If you crash your car, your car insurance can help to repair or replace it

so you can get back on the road again quickly. There are two types of

coverages to consider:

For each of these coverages, you may be responsible for the deductible

amount you’ve selected. (See page 11 for more about deductibles.) 

Collision Coverage pays for damage to your car if you
collide with another car or something else such as a building,
bridge or tree. If someone hits your parked car, this is considered
a collision as well.

Comprehensive Coverage pays for damage or loss 
to your car caused by something other than a collision such as
theft, fire, vandalism, windstorm or hitting an animal.

What about damage to your car?

If you’re in an accident, Collision or
Comprehensive Coverage can help 
pay for the repair or replacement 
of your car. 


Towing and Labor Costs reimburses you for towing and
basic roadside-assistance expenses if you’re stranded on the road.   

Rental Reimbursement repays you for the cost of
renting a car while yours is in the shop being repaired due to a
covered accident—up to 30 days.

Sound System Coverage protects your investment
from theft or damage if you’ve installed a high-end sound system
in your car. Call your Allstate Agent or 1-800-ALLSTATE to see if
your system qualifies. 

There are other coverages you
can buy to protect your car.

Allstate offers other coverages for additional protection for you

and your car. If you have selected these coverages, they will

appear under “Coverage” on your Allstate Policy Declarations. 



If you’re stranded on the road,
Towing and Labor Costs can help
reimburse you for towing and other
basic roadside-assistance expenses.



About deductibles.
A deductible is the amount of money you agree to pay to help 

repair or replace your car if you have a claim covered by your policy. 

Example: A driver damages his car in an accident and it will 
cost $5,000 to repair. 



Choosing a higher deductible means you might pay less for

your insurance premium now, but you should be prepared to

pay more out of your own pocket later if you have an accident.



About coverage limits.
Each coverage has a limit. If you have an accident claim covered by

your Allstate policy, Allstate agrees to pay for damages up to that

coverage’s limit. 

Example: A driver causes an accident in which someone is injured.
The case goes to trial and there is a verdict to compensate the
injured person with $57,000.



Choosing a higher limit means you might pay more for your

insurance premium now, but it could help protect you from

having to pay other people’s expenses later.



Frequently asked questions.
Q: How long will it take to get my car returned?
A: Every claim is unique, and there are a lot of different things

that could affect how long it takes to resolve your claim.

professionals who will always do their best to get your claim
resolved efficiently. You can help your claim go smoothly 
by providing Allstate with all the information you can about
the incident. 

Q: Will my policy pay for a rental car until my car is repaired?
A: If you selected Rental Reimbursement as a coverage option,

Allstate will reimburse you for a car rental for up to 30 days
after a covered claim, up to the dollar amount per day that’s
shown on your Policy Declarations. See your policy for 
a complete description of terms and limitations. 

Q: The accident wasn’t my fault. Shouldn’t the other driver 
pay my deductible?

A: If the claim investigation reveals that there’s a chance to
recover the damages from the person responsible for the
accident, Allstate will try to recover the damages, including
your share of the deductible.

FAQs



Q: Will my insurance premium increase if I file a claim? 
A: Every policyholder’s situation is unique, so depending on 

your circumstances, your premium may be affected. If you 
are concerned, don’t hesitate to discuss it with your Allstate
Agent. You may also want to ask them about Accident
Forgiveness, which may help prevent your rates from going 
up just because of an accident, even if it’s your fault. 

Q: My teen is about to enter the driving world. Is there
something I can do to prepare? 

A: Talk with them. To help you do this, Allstate offers a range of
tools including an interactive Parent-Teen Driving Contract,
information about Graduated Driver Licensing Laws for your
state and tips for how to help teens keep safe on the road. 
For more information, contact your local Allstate Agent or
visit allstateteendriver.com.

Q: I'm thinking of buying a motorcycle. Can I just add it to 
my auto policy?

A: Unfortunately, no. Having the right motorcycle coverage 
is very important and also very different from your car
insurance, so you will need a separate policy. The good news
is it won’t cost you as much as you might think and you could
qualify for a multi-line discount. Call your local Allstate Agent
or 1-800-ALLSTATE for a quote. 

Q: My windshield was damaged by a falling rock. Is that covered?
A: In most cases, this type of damage is covered under your

Comprehensive Coverage. For extra fast service, contact 
our Glass Claim Express® at 1-800-626-4527.
